- abstract window model
# mostly because 1010/kendo window data is scattered everywhere, but also so we can apply layout generically to other windowing tools and/or widgets
  - id
  - x y z w h
  - title
  - modal
  - resizable (implies maximizable)
  - maximized
  - minimized
  - minimizable
  - pinned

- workspace concept

  - data model = collection of variables
    - xml/query variables (representing user's content)
      - queries can be based on each other in a graph (by using issue xml=xxx)
    - visible variables
    - quickapp environments

  - view model = tree of components
    - tabs, windows, etc

  - workspace is saved as a library
